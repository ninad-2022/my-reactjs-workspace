    Events:-
      An activity performed at a specific time is called an event. 

  There are two categories of events. 

  1. User events - The event triggred by the website user 
    Ex:- click, change, mousemove,etc. 

  2. Browser events - The events triggred by the web browser 
    Ex: load, online, offline, etc. 


  Event Handling:- 
    Performing an operation in response to an event called event handling. 


There are three ways to handle the events. 
1. By using event attributes 
    There are event attribute available on html elements 
    The event attribute names starts with 'on' followed by event name 
    Example: 
      onclick 
      Here the event name is 'click'. 

      You can pass javasccript code to the event attribute directly

      <button onclick="alert('hi')">Click</button>
      
2. By using event properties 
3. By using addEventListener()

      
      
      
    </pre>

    <!-- here code gets mix with HTML element which is undesirable -->
    <button onclick="alert('hi')">Click</button>
    <p onclick="alert('this is para')">this is para</p>

    <button onclick="greet()">Greet</button>

    <hr />

    <button id="btn">Click Me</button>

    <hr />

    <button id="btn2">addEventListener</button>

    <script>
      function greet() {
        alert("Hi from js");
      }

      //here we have to assign a function, we cannot take string.
      var btn = document.getElementById("btn");
      // btn.onclick = "alert('hi')";
      btn.onclick = function () {
        alert("Hi from event property");
      };

      //   using addEventListener.
      var btn = document.getElementById("btn2");
      //var.addEventListner(objetEvent, function(){}) //propagation
      btn.addEventListener("click", function () {
        alert("HI from addEventListener");
      });
    </script>
  </body>
