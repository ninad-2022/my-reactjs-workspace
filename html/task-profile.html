				<h2>My-self</h2>
				<p>


Hey! I was born in Raigad and bought up in Navi Mumbai
currently, I am doing mech Engg from SCOE, Pune.
<br/>
I have industrial experience of 1 month as an internship trainee from H & R johnson Ltd and
15 days in S P L ltd both in Raigad where I got to know the actual working in industrial environment.
<br/>
I have worked on the project in my diploma where we have designed a heat exchanger by using EES software where i was responsible for leading my team and
I have been working on BE project that is experimentation on hydrodynamic cavitation 
for degrading of harmfull contents from waster water.
<br/>
I have participated in various state-level paper presentation competitions and won in various speech competitions
which developed good communication and presentation skills in me and this will surely help in dealing with cliets.
<br/>
Apart from my educational background I am an athlete, I represented  Maharashtra at state-level athletic meets in 2014-15 which made me a 
well-disciplined, hardworking and courageous individual.
<br/>
I am an active NSS volunteer, I have organized many activities along with my NSS team like online webinars, blood donation camps, cleanliness drives,
help to flood victim which developed management skills in me and this will help me in becoming an optimistic project engineer.<br/>
that's all about me up to.

			<h2>Project</h2>
			<h4>Design of HX on EES software</h4>

			<p>
				<h4><b>ABSTRACT</b></h4>
				<p>The heat exchanger is one of the most efficient devices which is used to transfer
heat from one fluid to another fluid without fluid contact. There are several types of
heat exchangers from which the most commonly used heat exchanger in an industrial
application is shell and tube heat exchanger. It has a heat exchanging range from -20
°C to 500°C. Shell, tubes, and baffles are the main components of the shell and tube
heat exchanger. The objective of the study is to design it for the cooling of hot fluid by
using cold fluid with a square layout. In this the four types of fluid like ammonia,
butene, ethanol & water with taking cold fluid the same as water. All calculation of the
heat exchanger is done on the EES (Engineering equation solver) software which give
an accurate value of all physical dimension of the heat exchanger, thermodynamic
properties of a fluid by mathematical calculation without fabrication. It is possible in
EES software to change all physical as well as a thermodynamic calculation by only
changing the name and properties of that fluid on EES. The effect of changing baffle
spacing is also studied. Baffles are used to increase the velocity of the fluid result in
changing the heat transfer performance of the heat exchanger. Baffle spacing is one of
the important parameters in shell and tube design. </p>
			
		<h4><b>Conclusion</b></h4>
		<p>This report demonstrates successful application of genetic algorithm for the
optimal design of shell-and-tube heat exchangers. Approximate design method for
shell-and-tube have been investigated and generalized procedure has been developed
to run the GA algorithm and to find the global minimum heat exchanger area. A case
study has been made for examination of the performance of genetic algorithm. From
this study we conclude that the combinatorial algorithms such as genetic algorithm
provide significant improvement in the optimal design compared to the traditional
designs. It concludes that it is easy to design heat exchanger and other devices on EES
software and the main advantage of EES software is that it gives accurate reading of all
physical and thermodynamic properties of the fluid hence the safe design is possible. It
reduces the human effort on designing procedure and also reduce cost by providing
accurate value without Fabrication hence there is no loss of scrap material. The main
advantage is that it gives values for all fluids by only changing name and properties in
EES software therefore no need of extra calculation for every fluid. </p>
